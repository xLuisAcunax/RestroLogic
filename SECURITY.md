If you discover a security vulnerability in RestroLogic, **please do not create a public issue**. Instead, report it directly to the maintainer via email at ldacuna83@gmail.com. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue and the potential impact.

**Response Process:**
- You will receive an initial reply within 48 hours acknowledging your report.
- Further details and timelines for the fix will be discussed directly via email.
- If the vulnerability is confirmed, a fix will be developed as soon as possible and credited appropriately (if you wish).

## Disclosure Policy

We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any public disclosure. Responsible disclosure helps keep all users safe.

## Security Best Practices

- Always keep your installation updated to the latest supported version.
- Report suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities promptly.
- Avoid sharing sensitive data in public forums or issues.

Thank you for helping us make RestroLogic more secure!
